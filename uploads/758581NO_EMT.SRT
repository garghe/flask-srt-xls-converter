00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,080
Krakow, Poland - a medieval masterpiece
flourishing in modern times.

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,640
It's the most beautiful city in Poland.

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,400
Old world traditions shape
an enduring food culture.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,440
It's basically peasant food at its best.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,680
Savory, stuffed pillows of dough
are a source of comfort and pride.

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,960
Whenever we need some good food
we have Pierogis.

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,040
And resilient people are fortified
with hearty meals.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,360
Krakow's all about the meat. You've got
great sausage, you've got great pork.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,960
These are the unique foods
that define a location.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,760
It's a traditional taste.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,840
And the legendary pleasures we'll travel
halfway around the world to eat.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,160
Golonka with beer, it's just the perfect
match.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm Andrew Zimmern. This is the Krakow,
another delicious destination!

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,160
BIZARRE FOODS
DELICIOUS DESTINATIONS

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,280
Krakow is a beautiful, welcoming city
that was once Poland's capital.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,560
For over five centuries, it was the
country's royal seat

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
and still retains much of its grandeur
and elegance.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Its rich past is reflected in the bustling
streets of old town

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,240
and the historic old Jewish quarter.

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,960
These days Krakow is the cultural
heart of the country.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,360
We were lucky because it was not
destroyed during The War.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,800
Legend says Krakow, one of Poland's
oldest cities,

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,840
was once home to a ravenous
fire-breathing dragon.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,440
The medieval, mythical beast has
become the symbol of the city.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,000
Another of the city's icons also dates
back to the middle ages... Pierogi,

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,680
boiled or fried dumplings with
savory or sweet fillings.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,920
When you think of Poland, it's Pierogi.
Every family has their different variety.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,560
Pierogi have likely been made
in Poland since the 13th century.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,600
Now some believe the savory
dumplings originated in China

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,960
and were brought to Europe
by Marco Polo;

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,640
others wager the Tartars introduced them
to the West from the Russian Empire.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,400
Polish cookbooks from the late 1600's

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,920
contained the first written Pierogi
recipes.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Pierogi are a specialty at U Babci Maliny,
which is located just off Rynek Gl�wny,

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,560
Krakow's central grand square, and the
hub of old town.

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,880
Chef Karol Wasowicz runs the restaurant.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,880
My parents opened the restaurant, and
the idea was to make people feel at home,

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,080
as if they were being served a dish
by their grandmother.

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,000
Their most popular Pierogi is the
"Ruskie,"

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
a heavily seasoned potato
and cheese variety.

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,280
The recipe originated in south-eastern
Poland, once called Red Ruthenia.

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,480
Ricing or grinding the potatoes adds
air, making them light and fluffy.

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,240
Karol uses springy Twar�g: Polish cheese
curds made from fresh cow's milk.

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,600
He combines the ground potatoes
and cheese by hand.

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,480
If we get too many potatoes, then the
filling will become runny-

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,480
and we don't want that.
It's similar with the cheese...

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,840
too much and it will become
too dense and crumbly.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,640
He adds dried herbs, spices and Maggi,

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,600
a savory, brown, MSG-rich flavoring agent
loaded with umami.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Traditional Ruskie Pierogi were
topped with fried onions...

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,520
The onion has to be fried well, golden
brown.

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,840
That gives the right taste and aroma,
and the filling will taste better.

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,280
Karol prefers to include caramelized
onions in the filling itself.

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
Historically the dough was a simple
mix of flour, water and salt.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,560
The updated version includes eggs and oil,

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,960
giving the wrappers a more luxurious,
pastry-like taste and feel.

57
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,480
The dough needs to be soft and tender.
We make it by hand.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,160
For 14 hours everyday, 3 chefs work
in shifts to roll the dough thin...

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,080
Then cut it into rounds.

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,600
Each one gets a heaping spoonful of
filling

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,000
before it's hand-crimped to form
a secure seal.

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,200
The Pierogi are boiled for about
6 to 8 minutes.

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,120
We need to wait until they start floating.
And every now and then give them a stir,

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,920
but very gently so that we don't damage
them.

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,680
The Pierogi are topped with crunchy fried
bacon, a dash of paprika,

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
and garnished with a red chili.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,360
I love them. The proportions between the
potato and cheese really go together,

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,440
the dough is really soft and the spices
have a good balance.

69
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,040
For me, Ruskie Pierogi have to have a lot
of well-fried onion, browned,

70
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
and a lot of pepper.
And then they taste good.

71
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
The best Ruskie Perogi should be rather
soft.

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,040
We don't make them at home as much,
they take a lot of time and effort.

73
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,800
This is why we like to come
to the restaurant to taste them.

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,640
With rustic peasant roots, Pierogi
are a beloved Polish dish.

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,760
Another humble, popular dish is
Golabki: stuffed cabbage rolls,

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,320
filled with any combination of ground
meat, whole grains and vegetables.

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
In Poland we eat a lot of cabbage.

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,760
In Golabki, cabbage is the main
ingredient.

79
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,360
It gives the dish its aroma, shape,
and creates the character of the dish.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,880
Variations on stuffed cabbage rolls are
found throughout Eastern Europe

81
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,120
and the Middle East, but in Poland
they are the stuff of legend.

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,480
It is said that in 1465 King Wladyslaw II
fed Golabki to his troops

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,240
before an important battle in the thirteen
years' war

84
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,720
and credited their victory
to the hearty meal.

85
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,480
In the oldest part of the city, in the
shadow of Wawel Castle

86
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,840
where King Wladyslaw II once
lived, you will find Pod Baranem.

87
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,840
Chef and owner Jan Baran starts his
Golabki by grinding pork belly and neck,

88
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,800
fortifying the meat with the whole kernels
of the buckwheat plant, known as groats.

89
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,920
The fat in the meat will be absorbed into
the cabbage and the groats,

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
and give them more flavor.

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,680
He seasons the mixture with wild mushroom
powder and porcini paste,

92
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,280
which adds an earthy flavor.

93
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Blanched white cabbage leaves
are the traditional wrapping.

94
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,800
The cabbage needs to be scalded, because
when it's raw it's fragile and can break

95
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,760
Golabki translates to "little pigeons"

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,320
because the shape of the cabbage leaves
was thought to resemble pigeon wings.

97
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,880
We compress them tightly because
the groats will expand as they cook.

98
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,120
This way, after baking, the Golabki
will not fall apart.

99
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,320
They're baked for an hour and a half in
a bit of water

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,720
with a cover of cabbage leaves
so they won't burn.

101
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,040
As the orders come in,
each Golabki is fried in butter.

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,800
After frying, the Golabki will become
crunchy and tasty.

103
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,600
They're served with Jan's creamy
porcini mushroom and dill gravy.

104
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,640
With the first bite, I was able to go back
in time to my childhood.

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,600
I taste mushroom, a lot of spices,
everything combined with the cream.

106
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,800
The cabbage basically melts in your mouth.

107
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,560
I grew up at the countryside, from the
early childhood,

108
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:56,240
I used to go with my mother to collect
mushrooms. It's a traditional taste.

109
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,840
Stuffed cabbage is a really traditional
dish here.

110
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,720
It's got all this great all the grains and
all the meats

111
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,440
and it's accented with all these
mushrooms. It's a hearty, filling dish.

112
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,920
The cabbage really can shine.
It's absolutely delicious.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,280
The meat of choice in Krakow is pork...

114
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,640
That includes its famous white sausage,
baked in beer, or fried in soup.

115
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,840
Since the renaissance, Krakow has been the
epicenter of arts and sciences in Poland.

116
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,160
It's home to several theaters,
art museums

117
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,120
and one of the world's oldest
universities.

118
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,280
Krakow is a city of artists, and people
live here a little bit differently.

119
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,200
The pace of life is somewhat slower.
Krakow is very romantic.

120
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,520
Old world foods are honored and beloved.

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
Cracovians are passionate
about the culinary arts.

122
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,720
That includes making Polish sausages
like Biala Kielbasa:

123
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,680
fresh white pork sausage, baked in beer
and served with fried onions and mustard.

124
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,720
Biala Kielbasa has always been popular.
I've been eating it my entire life.

125
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Poles have excelled in the art of making
Kielbasa since the 14th century

126
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,320
when royal hunting excursions
were a common tradition.

127
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,760
They needed to preserve game meats
like wild boar and venison,

128
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,400
so they cured it in salt and heavily
smoked it.

129
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,120
Today, most Kielbasa is made primarily of
pork, including the fresh, Biala Kielbasa.

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,280
Making Biala Kielbasa at home is
an Easter tradition in Krakow.

131
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,840
It's on the menu year-round at Kielbasa
I Sznurek, or "sausage and string,"

132
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,960
a cozy bistro nestled in an old cellar
off of Planty Krakowskie,

133
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,440
a public park that encircles
the old town.

134
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,360
Owner Alina Martus designed the restaurant
to have the feel of a country home.

135
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,800
I think that our Biala Kielbasa are
so popular with customers

136
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,720
because we use the best ingredients. Also,
we spice it with typical Polish spices.

137
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,400
The base of chef Dariusz Suwada's
Kielbasa

138
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,760
is ground pork shoulder, leg and belly.

139
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
He adds lean pork tenderloin for added
texture and leaf lard,

140
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,120
the prized fat around the kidneys,
for richness.

141
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,400
Usually the sausage is made with 2 or 3
cuts of meat.

142
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,000
We use 5 because it makes it
tastier and juicier.

143
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,840
Typical seasonings include salt, pepper,
garlic and marjoram,

144
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,320
a delicate, sweet, woodsy herb,
similar to oregano.

145
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,360
Dariusz also adds juniper, coriander and
finally lovage,

146
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,840
which adds a nuanced celery flavor.

147
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,440
We add these seven different spices
and as a result,

148
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,680
when you are eating the sausage,
you can smell the forest.

149
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,720
He stuffs the meat mixture
into natural casings...

150
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
Then gently poaches them in hot water.

151
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,760
Thanks to that, it will be better,
juicier.

152
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,720
He scores the cooked sausage.

153
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,920
This allows some fat to seep out and crisp
up the casing

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,960
as it pan-fries along with sweet onions.

155
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,080
Beer keeps the sausage moist
and adds a malty, earthy flavor.

156
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
He also adds whole grain mustard
and red chilis

157
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,160
before each order is baked and
served with a few slices of bread.

158
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,360
The sausage is flavorful, tender, and
quite spicy. It's made with fresh spices,

159
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,840
and you can taste that it was made here
just moments ago.

160
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,400
Biala Kielbasa for me is the taste of my
childhood

161
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,120
because my grandparents owned a farm and
they made Biala Kielbasa themselves.

162
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,280
When I eat this sausage,
I think about my childhood.

163
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,880
Biala Kielbasa is an essential ingredient
in a classic Crakovian soup... Zurek:

164
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,160
it's sour, salty and creamy,
made with vegetables,

165
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,480
whatever meat you have handy
and fermented rye flour.

166
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,240
Zurek is a very savory, sour soup,
that's it has very strong flavor.

167
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
It's a very old traditional soup.

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,360
During the communist era Zurek was
a staple at state run "milk bars" -

169
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,560
affordable cafeterias that were set up
by the Polish government

170
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,840
to help distribute excess products from
the country's booming dairy industry.

171
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,040
Meals at the local milk bar were often
included in a worker's salary.

172
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,760
When the communists fell in the 1990's,
so did Krakow's milk bars.

173
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,240
A few remain... Including Tomasza,
tucked down a cobblestone lane

174
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,080
behind St. Mary's Basilica in the center
of Old Town.

175
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,200
Owner Tom Naughton is an Irishman
who has lived in Krakow for 20 years.

176
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,720
I actually love the fact that's why I'm
getting to recreate something

177
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
that has been in Krak�w for the last
hundred years

178
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,440
but putting in a little bit
of a modern twist on it.

179
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,920
Sous-chef Dominik Starowic's Zurek starts
with a hearty vegetable stock.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,400
The most important thing in preparing
Zurek

181
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,160
is to keep the proportions right.

182
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,320
That means generous amounts
of alspice and bayleaf.

183
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,000
These herbs have a very strong, aromatic
taste and smell.

184
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,200
Thanks to that, the Zurek will have
a strong herbal flavor.

185
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,360
Generations ago, any leftover meat
would have been added to the pot.

186
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Dominik makes his with hearty chunks
of pan-fried Biala Kielbasa.

187
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,320
The mixture simmers for at least an hour

188
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,280
before he adds the soup's distinguishing
ingredient: Zakwas.

189
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,920
It's a culture of fermented rye flour
similar to sourdough

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,640
with a spicier, more complex flavor.

191
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,080
The fermented rye makes the soup more
sour and also gives it density.

192
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,320
Dominik finishes the soup with some
horseradish and loads of marjoram.

193
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,080
It's served with a hard-boiled
egg and cream.

194
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,000
Zurek has a unique taste. It's a bit sour
and not everybody will like it.

195
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,400
However, Polish people grew up
eating it and most like it.

196
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,400
The first Zurek I ever had was prepared by
my grandmother.

197
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,600
I like it the best during winter time,
it warms me up.

198
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,880
Warm, comforting foods are Krakow
specialties...

199
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,440
Including one that takes about 15 days
to perfect.

200
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,960
Poland's central location in Northeastern
Europe has, over the centuries,

201
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,040
made it a crossroads for conflicts.

202
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
The country has been conquered,
occupied and partitioned

203
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,840
and its food has absorbed more than
its fair share of external influences.

204
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,800
One foreign favorite that Cracovians
have made their own is Golonka:

205
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,880
whole roasted pork knuckle, braised
in beer, served on the bone.

206
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,720
I believe that we have borrowed this dish
from our German neighbors,

207
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,240
but we have perfected the art... and now
I believe we are better at it.

208
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,120
Golonka originated in the 18th century
in the kingdom of Prussia,

209
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
which is now part of Germany.

210
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,320
The pork knuckle, or "ham hock", from the
lower part of a hog leg

211
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,680
was an undesirable cut, requiring a lot
of time and effort to become edible.

212
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,200
The Poles rose to the challenge
and today,

213
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,400
pork knuckle festivals are celebrated
throughout the country.

214
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Golonka is the inspiration for the
Golonkarnia Restaurant,

215
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,320
located on the banks of the Vistula river,
just west of old town and Wawel Castle.

216
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,480
Marcin Moskala opened the restaurant
10 years ago.

217
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,760
What I love is rustic, simple food.

218
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,120
I like the type of food that is close
to nature.

219
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,040
Chef Andrei Suder's Golonka
takes 15 days to make.

220
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,200
It's a recipe that Marcin found in old
pre-World War II cookbooks.

221
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,400
To tenderize the tough pork knuckle,
he brines it for 14 days

222
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,040
in salt water along with bay leaf
and allspice,

223
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,640
imported to Europe by traders
from the Caribbean in the 1500's.

224
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,320
The meat will absorb the salt
and all the other spices.

225
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,640
Andrei boils the brined hocks, further
tenderizing the meat

226
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
before he scores the skin.

227
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,040
I'm making these cuts so that later,
after the pork knuckle has been baked,

228
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,160
it will be easier to cut open.

229
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,560
He rubs them with salt before
dousing them in Polish beer.

230
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,480
Then he braises the hocks low and
slow in his wood fired oven...

231
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,960
Beer prevents the pork knuckle from drying
out.

232
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,520
Basically it acts as a natural
moisturizer.

233
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,840
Each hock is finished to order, and
the skin becomes brown and crispy.

234
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,360
It's served with pickles, bread,
horseradish, mustard,

235
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,120
and of course, a cold beer.

236
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,440
Golonka with beer, it's just the perfect
match.

237
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Like the cinema without popcorn is not
possible?

238
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,480
Golonka without beer is not possible.
It's so delicious.

239
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,920
It's surprising that when you first cut
into the Golonka

240
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,520
you can hear the crunchiness of the skin.
And then when you taste it,

241
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,960
you get the flavor of the fat followed
by the tender lean meat.

242
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,560
Krakow is the city of Golonka.

243
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,040
I could smell the aroma of the meat when I
walked into the restaurant.

244
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,760
When I found out there was Golonka here,
I immediately felt hungry.

245
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,800
While Cracovians love meat-heavy meals,

246
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,240
their famous on-the-go snack is a simple
treat bakers have made here for 600 years.

247
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,160
The main market square in Krakow's
historic old town

248
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,000
is one of the largest medieval town
squares in Europe.

249
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,640
This 10-acre plaza is still the place
to come for a Krakow treat

250
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,520
that's been served here for over
600 years...

251
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,040
Obwarzanek: baked bread rings
made with various toppings.

252
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,480
You can buy them in the small carts that
you can see everywhere here in Krakow.

253
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Got a lot of flavors and you can choose

254
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,160
the flavor you really like,
like for example this one is with cheese.

255
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,880
Both Obwarzanek and bagels date back
to the Middle Ages

256
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,120
and most likely derived
from the German pretzel.

257
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,240
Like pretzels, Krakow's Obwarzanek were
eaten during lent or as communion bread.

258
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,480
As their popularity grew, they became
an everyday snack.

259
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,440
You can get authentic Obwarzanek from
a handful of certified bakers in Krakow,

260
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,200
like the popular Piekarnia Krakowianka

261
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,080
which sells over 6,000 Obwarzanek a day
from carts all over the city.

262
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,960
The small bakery is located in the Kleparz
neighborhood,

263
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,160
known for its art nouveau architecture.

264
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,040
It has been run the by the same family
for over 75 years.

265
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Bakery manager Mariusz Cubala
has worked here since 1989.

266
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,120
It's well known that this is a small
bakery. There are some bigger ones,

267
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,080
but this is a family bakery and not an
industrial facility.

268
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,400
The process starts with a simple
dough cut into strips by hand.

269
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,360
Every baker will have their own secrets

270
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,360
and everyone will make Obwarzanek their
own way.

271
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,960
Obwarzanek are bigger and
thinner than bagels.

272
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,320
Mariusz rolls each piece by hand,
connecting the ends...

273
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,440
Clearly he's done this
a time or two before.

274
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,240
The most important thing is to twist the
Obwarzanek.

275
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,200
If it's straight, it won't have the right
look.

276
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,640
This moment -pressing the ends to connect
them-- is the most important part...

277
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,320
so it will not fall apart
when it's cooking

278
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,640
Like a bagel, boiling the rings sets
the crust before baking.

279
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
This forms a barrier that will keep the
dough from rising,

280
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,480
and create a dense, chewy texture.

281
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,040
They're dipped in toppings like poppy
seeds, sesame seeds, salt, or cheese...

282
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,720
And placed on special baking racks.

283
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,920
This pattern is impressed onto the
Obwarzanek

284
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,880
and this is how we can tell
that this one is one of ours.

285
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,840
The Obwarzanek bake for 10 to 12 minutes,
leaving the inside dense and moist,

286
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,400
and the crust golden brown and crunchy.

287
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,520
The secret is to time it so that it's not
too puffy, but still crunchy.

288
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,240
The Obwarzanek are packaged up and
shipped out to street carts in Krakow.

289
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,120
This bread is a good snack. It's a lot of
warm, it's fresh. It's easy to pick up.

I remember Obwarzanek from my childhood.
Kids like it, older people like it.

291
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
You eat them when you're hungry
in downtown Krakow.

292
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,960
I have been eating Obwarzanek for 50
years now.

293
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,440
They are tasty and crunchy.
I recommend it to everyone.

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,680
Enchanting and historic,
Krakow seduces you

295
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,560
with its grand castles and cobblestone
streets.

296
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,960
Comforting Pierogies, heartwarming
soups and hearty pork dishes

297
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,400
bring the city's captivating past alive.
